EXPERT FORENSIC OPINION
-------------------------
**Forensic Pathology Report**

**Case Number:** [Insert Case Number Here]  
**Date:** October 29, 2025

**Deceased:** Mrs. Amaka Oni  
**Date of Death:** June 17, 2025 (Estimated)

**1. Cause of Death:**

* **Immediate Cause of Death:** Exsanguination secondary to sharp force injury to the left carotid artery.
* **Underlying Cause of Death:** Multiple incised wounds to the neck and upper chest, consistent with homicidal attack.

**2. Manner of Death:**

Homicide. The pattern, location, and severity of wounds, combined with the scene investigation, strongly indicate intentional infliction of fatal injuries by another individual.

**3. Contributing Factors:**

The presence of defensive wounds on the upper limbs suggests an attempted self-defense. No intoxicants or sedatives were detected in initial toxicology, implying full awareness at the time of attack.

**4. Time of Death Assessment:**

Based on algor mortis (body temp 26°C), fixed livor mortis, and rigor mortis partially resolved, the time of death is estimated at 3:50 AM on June 17, 2025 (±2.5 hours). These findings are consistent with the last known sighting by neighbors at around 10:30 PM on June 16.

**5. Toxicological Significance of Findings:**

Toxicology was negative for ethanol, opioids, benzodiazepines, and carbon monoxide. No toxic agents contributed to death. The absence of substances suggests the victim was alert and conscious during the assault.

**6. Scene Correlation with Autopsy Findings:**

The scene was disordered, with blood spatter patterns matching the trajectory of wounds. A bloodied kitchen knife recovered near the body shows partial fingerprints and tissue traces. No sign of forced entry, suggesting the attacker was known to the victim or had access.

**7. Differential Diagnoses Considered and Excluded:**

* **Suicide:** Excluded due to the location, number, and nature of wounds (multiple deep incisions in non-accessible areas).
* **Accident:** Excluded. The wound patterns are inconsistent with accidental injury and are characteristic of directed, repeated assault.
* **Natural causes:** Excluded. No internal disease or organ dysfunction contributed to death.

**8. Recommendations for Additional Testing:**

* **DNA testing** on blood under fingernails and on the knife handle.
* **Trace analysis** of fibers found in clenched fist (suggestive of struggle).
* **Fingerprint enhancement** using alternate light source and cyanoacrylate fuming.
* **Security footage** from estate premises to confirm possible suspect movement.

**9. Degree of Medical Certainty:**

Given the complete autopsy, lack of toxins, and strong correlation between scene findings and wounds, the cause and manner of death determination carries a **95% confidence level**.
